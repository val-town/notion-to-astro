# notion-to-astro

So you've written your documentation in [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)
but want to switch
to [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) to publish it.
So have we! This is the script we used to convert from one to the other.
Here's what it does:

| Notion                             | Astro Starlight              |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| File names include UUIDs           | Clean file names             |
| Title is the first h1 heading      | Title is in YAML frontmatter |
| Embeds are self-links              | Embeds are HTML              |
| Exports `<aside></aside>` elements | Wants [`::note` syntax][1]   |
| Links & images are URL-encoded     | They aren't                  |

## Notion bugs

This fixes a bug in Notion: if you have a link in Notion, and the link
text is an inline code span, like in markdown:

```markdown
[`getTest`](https://google.com/)
```

Notion messes this up and outputs this instead:

```markdown
`[getTest](https://google.com/)`
```

So any roughly Commonmark Markdown implementation will render
the latter as the markdown raw text rather than the intended link.

## YouTube embeds

This is kind of opinionated about YouTube embeds: it compiles them
to [lite-youtube-embed](https://github.com/paulirish/lite-youtube-embed/) elements.
So an embed will end up looking like:

```html
<lite-youtube videoid="ogfYd705cRs"></lite-youtube>
```

So, this assumes that you're using lite-youtube-embed. Which you should because it's great.
In Astro Starlight, we configure lite-youtube-embed like this:

```ts
starlight({
  // â€¦
  head: [
    {
      tag: "script",
      attrs: {
        src: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lite-youtube-embed@0.3.0/src/lite-yt-embed.min.js",
        defer: true,
      },
    },
    {
      tag: "link",
      attrs: {
        href: "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/lite-youtube-embed@0.3.0/src/lite-yt-embed.min.css",
        rel: "stylesheet",
      },
    },
  ],
});
```

If you need this to have customizable behavior instead, happy to accept a PR.

## Install

```sh
npx @valtown/notion-to-astro
```

## Usage

```sh
npx @valtown/notion-to-astro --help
```

## One-pass

This is intended to be run once in order to start a conversion,
and then you'd do some manual tweaking. It isn't a solution to
maintain content in Notion while publishing with Starlight:
that would require something a lot more complicated.
